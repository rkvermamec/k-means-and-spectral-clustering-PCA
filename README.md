# k-means and spectral clustering and Principal Component Analysis(PCA)

### Q1. Implement the k-means and spectral clustering algorithms for clustering the points given in the datasets: http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/jain.txt. Plot the obtained results. In order to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, find the percentage of points for which the estimated cluster label is correct. Report the accuracy of both the algorithm. The ground truth clustering is given as the third column of the given text file.


### Q3. Implement the Principal Component Analysis algorithm for reducing the dimensionality of the points given in the datasets: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data. Each point of this dataset is a 4-dimensional vector (d = 4) given in the first column of the datafile. Reduce the dimensionality to 2 (k = 2). This dataset contains 3 clusters. Ground-truth cluster IDs are given as the fifth column of the data file. In order to evaluate the performance of the PCA algorithm, perform clustering (in 3 clusters) before and after dimensionality reduction using the Spectral Clustering algorithm and then find the percentage of points for which the estimated cluster label is correct. Report the accuracy of the Spectral Clustering algorithm before and after the dimensionality reduction. Report the reconstruction error for k = 1, 2, 3, 4.
